# Contributing

Interested in hacking on Captured? Awesome. Below is an outline of how our
process works.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your
interactions with the project.

## Contributions Under MIT License

Whenever you make a contribution to Captured, you license your contribution
under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your
contribution under those terms. See the [GitHub TOS][ghtos] or
[LICENSE][license] for details.

## Pull Request Process

## Contributing a feature

In order to contribute a feature to Captured you'll need to go through the
following steps:

*   If you'd like to propose an idea, or have discussed in detail with the
    maintainers, [create a GitHub issue](ghissue) to track the
    discussion.  The issue should include information about the requirements
    and use cases that it is trying to address. Include a discussion of the
    proposed design and technical details of the implementation in the issue.
*   We care about commit messages, [A Note About Git Commit Messages][commit]
    covers the details.
*   Submit a [Pull Request][ghpr] to with your code changes.

*Note that we prefer bite-sized PRs instead of giant monster PRs. It's therefore
preferable if you can introduce large features in small, individually-reviewable
PRs that build on top of one another.*

If you would like to skip the process of submitting an issue and instead would
prefer to just submit a pull request with your desired code changes then that's
fine. But keep in mind that there is no guarantee of it being accepted and so it
is usually best to get agreement on the idea/design before time is spent coding
it. However, sometimes seeing the exact code change can help focus discussions,
so the choice is up to you.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at team@capturedapp.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
