Fixing the load paths
=====================

    install_name_tool -change /usr/local/lib/libssh2.1.dylib @loader_path/libssh2.1.dylib ./libcurl

    install_name_tool -id @executable_path/../Frameworks/libcurl.framework/Versions/A/libssh2.1.dylib ./libssh2.1.dylib

Removign ppc Arch
=================

    lipo -remove ppc Growl.framework/Growl -output Growl.framework/GrowlIntel

Code Signing
============

    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./libcurl.framework/Versions/A/libcurl
    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./libcurl.framework/Versions/A/libssh2.1.dylib
    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./Growl.framework/Versions/A/Growl
    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./GData.framework/Versions/A/GData

http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#technotes/tn2206/_index.html Says to do the above here:

Signing Frameworks
------------------
Seeing as frameworks are bundles it would seem logical to conclude that you can sign a framework directly. However, this is not the case. To avoid problems when signing frameworks make sure that you sign a specific version as opposed to the whole framework:

    $admin> # This is the wrong way:
    $admin> codesign -s my-signing-identity ../FooBarBaz.framework
    $admin> # This is the right way:
    $admin> codesign -s my-signing-identity ../FooBarBaz.framework/Versions/A

So maybe this will help:

    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./libcurl.framework
    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./Growl.framework
    codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Christopher Sexton" ./GData.framework
